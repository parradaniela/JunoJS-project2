jQuery App - Pokemon Type Search

## Overview
This is an app designed to practice working with jQuery and RESTful APIs. The user can enter a Pokemon type into the search box, and the app uses different API endpoints to first match the input to the correct type, then fetch a list of all Pokemon that have that type. It then displays the Pokemon on a list on the page.
